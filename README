hershey_text is a Blender addon that lets you render text objects as
curves using Hershey fonts <http://www.whence.com/hershey-fonts/>.
Besides the Hershey fonts, you also need to have my HersheyPy module
installed, which can be obtained from GitLab
<https://gitlab.com/ldo/hersheypy> or GitHub
<https://github.com/ldo/hersheypy>.
